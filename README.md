Establishing A Collaborative Python Environment

This homework assignment is to establish best practices for creating a collaborate coding environment. This will be important as you start working on your Semester Project with your group.

Task 1: Download and install python

Install Python 3.11. There are many potential choices of ways to do this, but the easiest is likely using Acaconda

Download the Anaconda Individual Edition that is appropriate for your computer
Documentation for installing on Windows: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/Links to an external site.
Documentation for installing on macOS: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/Links to an external site.
Documentation for installing on Linux: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/Links to an external site.
Create your first python script with Anaconda
Follow along with Getting started with Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/Links to an external site.
Complete a modified version of the Run Python in Spyder IDE for your sample python code that will be used in Task 2.
Install Spyder from the Applications pane
Launch Spyder
In a new file on the left, delete any placehold text, then type or copy/paste:
print(“Hello Quantitative Physiology Class”)
In the top menu, click File – Save As and name your program as “LastName_FirstScript.py” (where LastName should be replaced by your last name, so for Dr. Bowe the sample code would be. “Bowe_FirstScript.py”
Run your new program by clicking the triangle Run button
You should be able to see your program’s output in the bottom right of the Console pane.
To close Spyder, go to the top menu bar, select Spyder – Quit Spyder.
Task 2: Create a collaborative coding environment with your group

Complete the five steps in First Day on GitHub Learning Path

Watch the "Introduction to GitHub" at GitHub Skills: 
https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-githubLinks to an external site.Links to an external site.
Dr. Bowe (Mtbowe94) has created a repository called QuantPhysCollabPythonHWSpr24
Using the workflow outlined in the First Day on GitHub Learning Path, upload your sample python code from Task 1 into this repository
Optional: Download and use GitHubDesktop for managing your collaborative coding environment
https://desktop.github.com/Links to an external site.
You will be evaluated by completing these two tasks through (a) uploading screenshots of successful python installation on your laptop on Canvas (10pts) and (2) successfully contributing your sample python code to the QuantPhysCollabPythonHWSpr24 repository (10pts) before the deadline.
